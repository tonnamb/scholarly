How it works:
1. Search
2. Categorize some items to train Naive Bayes classifer
3. Apply the classifier to the other items

Made with:
* JavaScript
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org)
* [redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise)
* [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
* [bayes](https://github.com/ttezel/bayes)
* Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

Commands:
* Start server: `npm start`
* Run tests: `npm test`

To-do:
1. Prevent categories `all` and `cannot classify`
2. Display entered categories while training
3. Auto-complete entered categories while training
4. Allow multiple pages of training sample
5. Display multiple pages of classified results
6. Undo action for training
